# Film Analyzer
This is a side project I'm working on as a passion project. It combines some data science with my love of ultimate frisbee. This is a very bare-bones model right now, and still requires a decent amount of manual labor to get the initial data for the script to scrape from. 

## To-do
- Add clean holds
- Add # of turnovers
- Wind mph per game?
- Notes for each game (injuries, mental state, etc)
- Any suggestions you may have!
